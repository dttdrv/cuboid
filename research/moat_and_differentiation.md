# Cuboid Moat + Differentiation Thesis

Date: 2026-02-10

## Primary Thesis

Compete by being the most trustworthy **agentic LaTeX workspace** for technical teams that want AI power without surrendering editorial control.

## Differentiators (intentional)

1. Hard AI-Off mode as first-class policy.
- App remains fully usable for editing/compile with zero AI calls.
- This is a practical compliance and trust differentiator.

2. Bring-your-model architecture.
- Provider abstraction first; currently NVIDIA Build API for v1 slice, but adapter contracts enable direct provider routing later.
- Position as model-agnostic infrastructure, not model-locked UX.

3. Backend-first reliability.
- Deterministic compile queue, structured diagnostics, local artifact lineage.
- Build correctness before UI flourish.

4. Local-first by default.
- No database dependency in v1.
- Filesystem-native projects and reproducible local workflows.

5. Explicit evidence labeling in competitor intelligence.
- `verified` vs `inferred` vs `unknown` avoids strategic self-delusion.

## Near-term Moat Builders (post-v1)

1. Superior compile explainability:
- ranked root-cause hints for LaTeX failures.

2. Agent auditability:
- every AI action logged as proposal -> accept/reject trace.

3. Research-aware context packs:
- section graph, bibliography graph, equation context injection.

4. Enterprise controls:
- allowlists, key handling policies, local/offline modes.

## Things We Avoid

1. Chasing visual parity before backend reliability.
2. Making AI mandatory for core workflows.
3. Claiming competitor internals without evidence.
