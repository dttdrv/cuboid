# Funding Narrative Draft (Mistral-Aligned Prism Alternative)

Date: 2026-02-10

## One-liner

Cuboid is an agentic LaTeX workspace where humans remain in command: model-agnostic by architecture, Mistral-ready by integration, and production-minded from backend to policy.

## Why this is investable

1. Market pull is clear.
- Scientific/technical authoring remains painful.
- Prism validates demand for AI-native document workflows.

2. We are not a thin wrapper.
- Compile reliability and policy controls are core product, not a plugin.
- AI is assistive and optional, which broadens adoption in sensitive environments.

3. Distribution angle for an AI company partner.
- Cuboid can ship with “use <partner model> in your writing IDE” positioning.
- Creates higher-frequency model usage in a non-chat vertical workflow.

## Why Mistral fit is strong

1. Strong model family with growing enterprise positioning.
2. Strategic value in a model-agnostic app that can still showcase Mistral as the default high-quality profile.
3. Cuboid architecture supports direct-provider mode after initial OpenRouter-first launch.

## 12-Month Product Story

1. Q1-Q2: local-first reliability and policy controls (current program).
2. Q2-Q3: collaboration + richer AI action traces.
3. Q3-Q4: enterprise controls and partner model bundles.

## Ask framing

1. Technical partnership:
- model credits + guidance on best inference profiles for editing/reasoning tasks.

2. Distribution:
- co-marketing as “agentic scientific writing workspace powered by <partner>”.

3. Optional capital:
- finance collaboration and enterprise-hardening roadmap.
