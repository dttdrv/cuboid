# Prism Parity Checklist (Core + Near-Term)

Benchmark note (2026-02-10 UTC):
- Current Prism page reachable at `https://openai.com/prism`.
- Legacy link `https://openai.com/index/prism` observed as unstable/404.

## Core parity (target now)
- [x] Workspace selection and project-context routing continuity
- [x] Editor shell with assistant/comments/activity panels
- [x] Compile-to-preview and export controls
- [x] Diagnostics surfaced with editor jumps
- [x] Change proposals and accept/reject interaction loop

## Near-term parity (local-first stubs in this phase)
- [x] Collaboration infrastructure seam (local-first manager + hardened room identity checks)
- [x] Citation/reference retrieval seam (Crossref/arXiv tool path)
- [x] Data-to-table/spreadsheet capability placeholder (deferred adapter contract)
- [x] External research connector placeholder (deferred adapter contract)

## Deferred parity items
- [ ] Cloud-backed multi-user reliability and permissions model
- [ ] Production-grade integration marketplace/connectors
- [ ] Backend event telemetry and replayable audit traces
