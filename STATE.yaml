status: phase_2_ui_refinement
goals:
  - current: Stabilize Prism-style editor UX and interaction wiring
  - pending: Deep polish pass for responsive/mobile and animation nuance
constraints:
  - local-first
  - no-backend
  - aesthetic: Charcoal (#0d0e0d), minimal chrome
  - avoid regressions in auth/workspace routing
decisions:
  - editor_shell: Three-pane workspace with tabbed right rail (Preview/Assistant/Activity/Comments)
  - interactions: Removed dead controls by wiring all visible editor/dashboard buttons
  - showcase: Playwright visual artifacts stored under showcase/after
risks:
  - precision_gap: Visual fidelity still not 1:1 vs Prism screenshots
  - ai_depth: Assistant/logs behaviors are currently local stubs, not backend-driven
next_steps:
  - Iterate typography density and spacing from screenshot diffs
  - Add richer actionable logs/comments data flows from real compile/AI layers
