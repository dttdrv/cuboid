status: phase5_ui_refinements_complete
goals:
  - current: Production polish on editor shell — interaction quality, accessibility, visual consistency
  - completed: Phase 5 UI refinements (all 7 components polished)
  - pending: Phase 2 multi-file support, Phase 3 chat mode
constraints:
  - local-first
  - no-cloud-runtime-in-this-phase
  - aesthetic: Hard-square industrial minimal with IBM Plex Sans + JetBrains Mono
  - preserve auth/workspace/project routing semantics
decisions:
  - ui_system: Agent-led shell architecture with composer-centered workflow
  - dropdown_dismiss: Click-outside via useClickOutside hook (replaces onMouseLeave)
  - input_mode: Growing textarea with Shift+Enter for newlines
  - pdf_dark_mode: CSS invert filter approach (no re-render)
  - compile_indicator: Compact dot + text in top-right of editor area
risks:
  - strict_type_baseline: pre-existing tsc strict errors remain in legacy core/worker paths
  - modal_consistency_gap: settings/modal/menu consistency is still partially migrated
  - production_auth: local auth/session implementation remains demo-grade
next_steps:
  - Phase 2: Multi-file support (fileList, contentMap, tab management)
  - Phase 3: Chat mode (chatStore CRUD, session wiring, message persistence)
  - Gather user feedback on Phase 5 polish
