# Prism Inspiration UI Image Summary

Scope note:
- This file summarizes what each screenshot in `prism_inspo_ui` represents.
- `Image to LaTeX` and `Voicemode` are included for context but are marked as **deferred** (not current priority).

## Per-image summary

1. `1.png`: Projects dashboard baseline. Left workspace navigation, project list focus, top global search, view toggle, import/new actions.
2. `2.png`: Full editor runtime in 3-pane mode. Left file/chat rail, center LaTeX editor with agent input, right compile/PDF preview panel.
3. `3.png`: Right-side insights drawer, `Project Info` tab. Document metrics cards (word counts, headers, figures, math counts).
4. `4.png`: Right-side insights drawer, `Comments` tab. Search + filter shell for inline discussion/review flow.
5. `5.png`: Right-side insights drawer, `Logs` tab. Raw compile/runtime log visibility for debugging and transparency.
6. `6.png`: Editor with chat-focused left rail state. File/chat mode toggle and quick-start conversation entry (`New chat`).
7. `7.png`: Settings surface, `Editor` section. Theme/font controls and behavior toggles (auto-format, realtime compile, vim mode, word wrap).
8. `8.png`: Share modal. Access model switch (`Only invited users` vs `Anyone with link`) plus invite input flow.
9. `9.png`: Settings surface, `PDF Viewer` section. Display behavior toggles (dark mode and zoom shortcut override).
10. `10.png`: Settings surface, `File Management` section. Hidden-file rules list with add/remove management.
11. `11.png`: Composer tooltip for `Image to LaTeX`. Quick action concept for OCR-to-LaTeX extraction. **Deferred priority**.
12. `12.png`: PDF panel context menu. Presentation actions such as fullscreen and open-in-new-window.
13. `13.png`: Composer tooltip for `Voicemode`. Voice-driven editing concept. **Deferred priority**.
14. `14.png`: File actions dropdown from file rail. Add/upload entries and external connector placeholder (`Connecting to Zotero...`).
15. `15.png`: PDF zoom menu. Preset zoom levels plus zoom commands and fit behavior.
16. `16.png`: Dashboard import menu. Import entry points for archive and folder-based project intake.

## Directional takeaway (short)
- Prism’s UI framing is agent-first workflow orchestration, not editor-first utility chrome.
- Primary pattern to emulate now: reduce clutter, keep one clear active workflow, and make AI actions feel central but user-controlled.
